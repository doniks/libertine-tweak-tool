// Shells
l-c-m exec -c bash
    This command does not mount any user directories
    (/home/phablet will not exist) and is best used for
    making changes to the container's rootfs)

DISPLAY= libertine-launch <containerid (default is vivid)> bash
    This mounts user directories, but is no different than
    if you installed something like mate-terminal and ran it.
    The reason we are passing an empty DISPLAY variable is
    because libertine-launch will refuse to start if DISPLAY
    isn't set, even it if doesn't exist.

//Themes:

You can make your applications look great still, you don't have
to be stuck with the default Raleigh GTK style.
Download and install LXAppearance in your container and add
ppa:noobslab/themes then start installing themes. Enjoy!
The Ubuntu Touch Themes are wonderful and FlatPlat works well
with the system UI as well.
